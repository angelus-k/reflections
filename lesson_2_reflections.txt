What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A repository is initialized, but it's still empty. It needs to be done to
    add commits later on, which will enable version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The working directory represents the virtual space, where the files of the
    project are stored, while the staging area contains files selected for a
    commitment. The repository, on the other hand, is the whole record of all
    changes that have been made so far.
